    "\n",
    "Iris uses the [UGRID](http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions/) conventions encoding standard as its basis for representing meshes.  \n",
    "UGRID is an extension of the [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.10/cf-conventions.html).  It prescribes a CF-compatible way of recording meshes and mesh data in NetCDF files.  \n",

    "## Basic constructions\n",
    "\n",
    "UGRID can describe spatial **points**, **lines** and (polygonal) **faces**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate data can be associated with any of these -- e.g. sampled values at cell corners (points), \n",
    "or average values over each cell region (faces).\n",
    "\n",
    "UGRID's permitted element types are :\n",
    "  * **node** - a point in space, defined by some M coordinate values\n",
    "  * **edge** - a line between 2 end nodes\n",
    "  * **face** - a polygon with some N nodes as its corners\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, \"edges\" and \"faces\" are defined in terms of \"nodes\".  \n",
    "A **mesh** contains -\n",
    "  * arrays of coordinates which define its **nodes**, plus _optionally_ ..\n",
    "  * optional node-number arrays which add **edges** and/or **faces**, by listing the nodes which define them (i.e. their ends or corners)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, edges and faces can have associated coordinate values.\n",
    "These are independent of the nodes defining line-ends/face-vertices, and represent an additional associated\n",
    "spatial location for each element, often used to represent something like a mid-point."
